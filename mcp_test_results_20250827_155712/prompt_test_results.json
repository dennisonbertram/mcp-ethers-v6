                "text": "I need to resolve the ENS name 'vitalik.eth' and check the ETH balance of the resolved address on the polygon network. Please follow these steps:\n\n1. First, use the 'resolveName' tool with the provider set to 'Ethereum' to resolve the ENS name on Ethereum mainnet, as ENS domains are primarily registered there.\n\n2. Before proceeding with the target network:\n   - Use the 'getAllNetworks' tool to verify the exact name of the 'polygon' network\n   - If the provided name doesn't match exactly, identify the correct network name from the results\n\n3. After resolving the ENS name on Ethereum mainnet:\n   - Use the resolved Ethereum address to perform the requested balance operation on the target network\n   - Use the appropriate tool ('getWalletBalance', 'getWalletTransactionCount', or 'getContractCode') with the provider parameter set to the verified target network name\n\n4. Present the results clearly, specifying both:\n   - The original ENS name and its resolved address\n   - The network on which the operation was performed\n   - The complete results of the operation\n\nThis approach ensures reliable ENS resolution while allowing operations across any supported blockchain network."
